<h2>Substitution Rule:</h2>

<table>
<tr><th valign="top">Definition:</th>
<td>
A <b>substitute</b> (or sub) is a person who will be playing for a team but is not on that team's roster.<br />
<i>(Note: People on a team's roster who do not regularly play are not substitutes according
to this definition even though they are typically referred to as substitutes.)</i>
</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Substitutes must be one of the following (listed in order of precedence):</h4>

<ol>
<li>Not already listed on any PVA team's roster (regardless of league or night) AND added to the team's roster prior to the match (see "Roster Additions" below).</li>

<b>OR</b>

<li>Listed on another team's roster that plays in the same league OR a lower level league on the same night.</li>

<b>OR</b>

<li>Listed on another team's roster that plays on different night (league levels do not matter, see "Playing in Multiple Leagues" below).</li>
</ol>

<h4><i>Examples of substitution rule:</i></h4>

<i>
<ol>
<li>A "Roster Addition" email is sent 5 minutes before the start of a match so that a non-PVA player can play.</li>

<li>On Tuesday, a player who is on the roster of a "AA" team that played at 7pm is picked up as a sub for another "AA" team for an 8pm game.</li>

<li>A player who is only on the roster of an "A" level team on Wednesday can substitute for any level team on Thursday (e.g. a Thursday "B" team).</li>
<li>A player who is on the roster of a Tuesday "AA" team <b>cannot sub</b> for a Tuesday "A" team.</li>
<li>A player who is on the roster of a Tuesday "AA" team and a Wednesday "C" team <b>cannot sub</b> for a Tuesday "A" team. <i>(Note: Second substitution rule has precedence over the third rule.)</i></li>

</ol>
</i>

<h4>Substitutions during Playoffs</h4>

All of the previous substitution rules apply with the additional condition that the player
must have <b>subbed at least once</b> during the current season for the team needing a sub.
<i>(Note: This effectively eliminates the first substitution rule.)</i>

<h4>Roster Additions</h4>

Roster additions can be done at any time prior to the start of the match in which the new player will play. 
To make a roster addition,  send an email to <a href="mailto:info@portlandvolleyball.org">info@portlandvolleyball.org</a>
 with a subject of "Roster Addition" and containing the following information:

<ol>
<li>Name of person to be added</li>
<li>Team name</li>
<li>League</li>
<li>Night that the league plays on</li>
</ol>

<h4>Playing in Multiple Leagues</h4>

Players are not permitted to be on the roster for more than one team 
on any given night. Players are allowed to be on the rosters of multiple 
teams if each team plays on a different night. 
<p />

<h4>League Levels (ordered from highest to lowest skills)</h4>

<ol>
<li>AA</li>
<li>A</li>
<li>BB</li>
<li>B</li>
<li>C</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>League levels only apply to a given night<br />
    <i>(e.g. on Monday, the "BB" league has a higher skill level than the "B" league)</i></li>
<br />
<li>There is no correlation between leagues on different nights<br />
    <i>(e.g. the Thursday "B" league may have a higher skill level than the Wednesday "A" league)</i></li>
</ul>
